# Amazon_Vine_Analysis


### Overview of the analysis of the Vine program:

To analyze Amazon reviews and to compare the differences between paid and unpaid reviews and see if  


### Results:
The total number of paid reviews was far fewer than the number of unpaid reviews. 

There were a total of 613 paid reviews compared to 64, 968 unpaid reviews

There were 222 paid reviews with 5-star reviews and 30,543 unpaid 5,star reviews. 

The proportion of reviews with 5-star rating was lower if the reviews were paid: (222/613=36%) compared to the proportion with 5-star rating if the review was unpaid: (30,543/64,968=47%).

Additional analyses should be done using statistical tests such as chi squared test to see if the difference in proportion is significant. Additonal statistical analyses such as multivariate regression should be also used to see if the difference is only due to the paid factor or other factors such as age, gender, location could be contributing to this difference.  


### Summary: 

The results suggest that there is a small difference between the proportion of 5-star reviews being higher among the unpaid vs the paid group. Additional analyses are needed to evaluate this finding further.
